    I believe that experiences are the things that we can share the most as human beings. The experiences of feeling, doing, thinking, knowing and discovering new things about ourselves and the world that surrounds us and what it can become. Everything we think and imagine we have already created, we just need to implement it in our world.

    As a software developer, I believe that software is one of many mechanisms to make these experiences a reality. With software we can create dreams, solve problems and teach, and neither is less important than the other. It is the path that I found and chose to create those experiences.

    First of all, I must have a clear idea of what I am going to build. With that clear, I look for references if it has already been built before or dealt with certain related topics to find the best solution. Next, I plan what architecture and design it may have.To choose the tools that I will use, I look to see if one of them is easier or is made to deal more with the problem I am trying to face, be it the language, the libraries or the framework. Once these decisions have been made, I am trying to find design patterns that facilitate the maintenance and neatness of the code and the application itself so that it evolves appropriately.
